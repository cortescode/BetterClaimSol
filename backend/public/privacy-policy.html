    <p>At BetterClaimSOL, your privacy and trust are important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we use cookies, display public blockchain transaction data, and what limited information we collect on our website.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection and Use</h2>

    <p>BetterClaimSOL does not collect any personal information. The only data we interact with is public blockchain transaction data and referral codes, as outlined below:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Public Blockchain Data:</strong> When you use BetterClaimSOL, you authorise transactions on the Solana blockchain to close unused accounts and reclaim your SOL. These transaction IDs are publicly available on the blockchain and are displayed on our website in real-time for your convenience. We do not store or process this information beyond displaying it for transparency.</li>
        <li><strong>Cookies for Referral Codes:</strong> We use cookies to assign you a unique referral code. This cookie is stored locally on your device and is used only to track referrals. No personal data is collected or stored in association with these cookies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. No Data Sharing or Selling</h2>

    <p>We do not share, sell, or distribute any personal or transactional data, as we do not collect or process such data.</p>

    <h2>3. Your Control</h2>

    <p>Since BetterClaimSOL does not retain any personal data, there is no additional action required to control or delete any personal information. You may delete any cookies in your browser at any time to remove your referral code tracking.</p>

    <h2>4. Security</h2>

    <p>BetterClaimSOL takes precautions to protect your data and ensures secure handling of all blockchain transactions. However, as blockchain data is public, transaction details may be accessible to anyone on the blockchain.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>

    <p>We may update this policy periodically, we will update the effective date and inform users directly on our website.</p>
